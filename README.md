### Project Description

This repository contains practice using queries to PostgreSQL and SQLite3 databases. The databases were directly connected through Jupyter Notebook. The project involves various types of queries, such as simple queries, subqueries, grouping, aggregation, joins, window functions, and others.

The SQLite3 database was created through Google Colab, and the PostgreSQL database was created in ElephantSQL. The dataframes are located in the "data" folder.
